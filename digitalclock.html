                <span class="translatable">
                    A 24-hour digital clock is an electronic timekeeping device that displays the hours and minutes
                    continuously in a non-stop format, using digital components such as counters, decoders, and
                    seven-segment displays. This type of clock is particularly useful in scenarios where time needs to
                    be tracked throughout the day and night. It finds applications in homes, offices, and various
                    industries where precise timekeeping is crucial for coordinating activities and processes. Building
                    a 24-hour digital clock is not only a practical endeavor but also an educational one, as it allows
                    individuals to apply digital circuitry principles and gain a deeper understanding of electronics
                    while creating a functional and reliable timekeeping device.

                            The foremost goal is to create a digital clock that accurately keeps track of time, down to

                            <span class="translatable">In my project, I employ a 555 timer in the astable mode, which
                                generates a quadratic
                                signal. This quadratic signal is a key component in activating the asynchronous
                                flip-flop
                                counters in the 74LS90. The frequency of the quadratic signal is a critical factor that
                                directly depends on the values of the resistors and capacitors in the circuit. By
                                carefully selecting and configuring these components, I can precisely control the output
                                frequency, allowing for efficient and reliable operation of the synchronous counters.
                                This setup plays a crucial role in various applications where accurate timing and
                                counting are essential, such as in digital electronics and sequential control systems.

                                We use a 74LS90 counter that integrates four JK flip-flops connected in series to
                                activate the JK input and in parallel in the clock pulse, these JK flip flops of the
                                74ls90 counter are activated low giving us an ascending count, forming an asynchronous
                                counter due to the series connection of the JK. Each of the flip flops within the
                                integrated symbol symbolizes a bit of information, so having 4 bits in this flip-flop
                                configuration is capable of counting up to 4 bits. I must remember that due to the use
                                of JK flip flops, it is called a counter, when using type D flip flops they would be
                                registers, in this case we will use the 4-bit output (denoted as ABCD bits) to establish
                                an interaction with a 74LS47

                                The decoder 74ls47 operates with 4-bit inputs, transforming them into seven different
                                signals.
                                This operation is essential, since the 7-segment display requires seven input variables
                                according to its truth table to activate the corresponding LEDs. These resulting signals
                                are used for precise control of the 7-segment display.

                                The counter implements a reset function, which is activated through pins 2 and 3. When
                                both pins receive a logic '1' signal, the counter resets to its initial state '0000',
                                starting the counting process. right from the start. It is planned to strategically use
                                this reset function when reaching both the number 6 and the number 24, using an AND
                                logic gate to manage this condition. This approach allows for efficient and accurate
                                count management, ensuring proper synchronization with system needs.</span>

                                The operation of the 7-segment display is governed by a specific truth table, where the
                                ABCD inputs are interpreted by the 74LS47 decoder to generate seven different outputs.
                                These outputs, arranged according to a predefined order, numerically represent the
                                digits on the display. For example, when the inputs are '0000', 4 LEDs arranged in a
                                circle are activated, indicating the number "0" in binary format.

                                This process of binary interpretation and decoding is finally translated into the visual
                                presentation of decimal numbers on the 7-segment display. In this way, the count
                                generated by the counter can be observed, first in binary format, then decoded by the
                                decoder and, finally, displayed on the 7-segment display. This comprehensive system
                                provides a clear and understandable representation of the count in progress.

                            <span class="translatable">
                                Ultimately, the comprehensive configuration breaks down as follows: six displays in
                                total, distributed in two sets for the seconds, two for the minutes and two for the
                                hours. Each counter is started by low pulses generated by a quadratic signal, or clock
                                pulse. In the case of the seconds counter, this signal comes from timer 555.

                                The first counter emits its signal to the second in a configuration that sets it to 0
                                when it reaches the counting limit (9 in this case). This results in a seconds counter,
                                which, in turn, is set to reset when it reaches the value 60, thus starting the minute
                                count. This process is repeated successively until the hours are reached, and a reset
                                mechanism is implemented when the end of the day is reached, that is, after 23:59:59. In
                                summary, the coordination between counter, decoder and display is precisely synchronized
                                to offer a continuous and structured representation of time in the format of hours,
                                minutes and seconds.</span>
