                <br>
                <span>
                    A 24-hour digital clock is an electronic timekeeping device that displays the hours and minutes
                    continuously in a non-stop format, using digital components such as counters, decoders, and
                    seven-segment displays. This type of clock is particularly useful in scenarios where time needs to
                    be tracked throughout the day and night. It finds applications in homes, offices, and various
                    industries where precise timekeeping is crucial for coordinating activities and processes. Building
                    a 24-hour digital clock is not only a practical endeavor but also an educational one, as it allows
                    individuals to apply digital circuitry principles and gain a deeper understanding of electronics
                    while creating a functional and reliable timekeeping device.

                    <br>

                    <h5 id="black">Precision Timekeeping: </h4>

                        <span>
                            The foremost goal is to create a digital clock that accurately keeps track of time, down to
                            the seconds and minutes. It should provide reliable time information for various
                            applications.

                            <span>
                                The clock should ensure synchronization among its internal components and functions,
                                enabling them to work together seamlessly. This synchronization is crucial in
                                time-sensitive operations and systems.

                            <span>In my project, I employ a 555 timer in the astable mode, which generates a quadratic
                                signal. This quadratic signal is a key component in activating the asynchronous
                                flip-flop
                                counters in the 74LS90. The frequency of the quadratic signal is a critical factor that
                                directly depends on the values of the resistors and capacitors in the circuit. By
                                carefully selecting and configuring these components, I can precisely control the output
                                frequency, allowing for efficient and reliable operation of the synchronous counters.
                                This setup plays a crucial role in various applications where accurate timing and
                                counting are essential, such as in digital electronics and sequential control systems.

                            <h3 class="title">74LS90 Digital Counter</h3>

                            <span>
                                We utilize a 74LS90 counter, composed of four JK flip-flops connected in series, making
                                it an asynchronous counter. Given the presence of these four flip-flops, it allows for a
                                4-bit count. We will employ this 4-bit output (ABCD bits) to interface with a 74LS47
                                decoder.
                            </span>

                            <br>
                            <span>
                                The decoder, in turn, takes these 4-bit inputs and decodes them into seven
                                signals, which are then used to drive a 7-segment display. This counter also features a
                                reset function, accessible via pins 2 and 3. When both of these pins receive a '1,' the
                                counter resets to '0000,' effectively starting the counting process anew. We plan to
                                employ this reset feature when we reach both the number 6 and the number 24 by using an
                                AND gate.</span>
